# 1. Introduction

Photon is a Game engine written in Python just for the fun of it. It uses libraries like [PyImGUI](https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui), [PyOpenGL](https://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) and [pyGLFW](https://github.com/FlorianRhiem/pyGLFW/) for a lot of graphical heavy-lifting.

The engine is based on [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), and support for [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) is planned for future. Although the engine uses [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) it uses multi-threaded architecture and asynchronous programming to load assets.

Photon draws a lot of insperation from [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), and a lot of learning from [The Cherno](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&si=joZeeB9E0mV37S28).
