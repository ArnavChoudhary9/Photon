# 14-12-2024

- Added setup system.
- Implemented program flow.
  - Added PhotonApplication class
  - Added Basic Run loop.
  - Added entry point for program.

## Interesting Things I learned

### 1. pip install for development

If you have a `setup.py` file in your project, you can use `pip install -e .` to install the package while you still work on it and also import it in other packages to use it, while it will automaticlly update as you work on it.

[Ref.](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html)

### 2. Relative paths in packages

If you are Package a project as pip package, put

```python
include_package_data=True,
package_data={"path": ["data/*", "config/*.json"]},
```

in your setup function and use `importlib.resources.open(pkg, filename)` function to open the file without worring about the path. You can also use `pkg_resources.resource_filename("path.config", filename)` to get exact filepaths.

[Ref. 1 - importlib.resources](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html)

[Ref. 2 - pkg_resources](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html)

### 3. To find subclasses of a class

Use the following snippit of code to get all subclasses of a class:

```python
import inspect
from typing import TypeVar

_T = TypeVar("_T")

def FindSubclass(cls: _T) -> _T:
    """Find a subclass of Application dynamically."""
    for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(sys.modules["__main__"]):
        if inspect.isclass(obj) and issubclass(obj, cls) and obj is not cls:
            return obj
    raise RuntimeError("No subclass of cls found in the main module.")
```
